When the moment's right
Only moments rise
For a lesser blessed
It'd all promises
When the donors rise
From their comas rise
For a lesser blessed
It seems honest here
Celebrate, give love and praise
Celebrate, for our lesser days
Obsessions in your eyes
The peril of my life
Where others fall
You came back again
With no grace in mind
See them make him blind
For a lesser god
We seem honest here
Bridge and you turn
You find new highways
And you'll turn
The lady you'll burn
This moment's all
You have it there
This moment hangs
Like your ragged hair
Celebrate, give love and praise
Celebrate, for our lesser days
When the moment's right
Only moments rise
You turn a sea mood silence
The shadows of mankind
And you'll turn
You find new highways
And you'll turn
You find new highways
Celebrate here
Celebrate yeah, please, for all you changed me
Celebrate yeah
Celebrate yeah
Celebrate for our lesser days
Love under will taken from the watchman (edition 1)

I need to be alone tonight
Smother me or suffer
Lay down i'll die tonight
Smother me or suffer
When i'm gone, wait here
Discover all of life's surprises
When i'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good smile
If you pass through my soul tonight
Gather all his troubles
Tomorrow's long eternal night
Gather for tomorrow
When i'm gone wait here
Discovers all of earth's surprises
When i'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good smile
Chorus: between the cracks and hollows -
The earth is good, the earth is good
Between the cracks and hollows -
The earth is good, the earth is good
Lay down, lay down, lay down for me
Lay down, lay down, lay down with me
When i'm gone wait here
Discover all of lifes surprises
When i'am gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good bye
Hey embrace me, someone's gonna suffer
Lay lay lay it on lay lay lay it on me
Someone
Hey embrace me someone's gonna suffer {repeat to fade}
Sweet dreams my angel
At last good bye
Sweet dreams
Last exit for the lost (straight from album cover)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Would you pay lifes pleasures to see me?
Does it hurt, for i want you to remain?
I run your hair through, in another decade
Summerland holds me, in sumerian haze
Pain in places, where the lovers mourn
Arranging the play things, up and down the hall
Forever remain, for every day
My honour remains, forever remain
Between the spaces along the wall
Appearing faces that disappear at dawn
We're getting closer, i can see the door
Closer and closer, kthulhu calls
Forever remain, forever remain
You'll seek it, it'll take a while
You'll seek this, if it's a thousand miles
Take what fate brings, eternal and desire
I'll change those faces, then i take their smile
We're getting close to you, i can see the door
Closer and closer, or is it there at all
Forever remain, forever remain
This could be my last regress, last exit for the lost
This could be my last regress, last exit for the lost
This could be my last regress, precious for the lost
