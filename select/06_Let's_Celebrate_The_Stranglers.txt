Got the chance of a real good time
If you're by yourself, don't hesitate
Spent too long on a wooden fence
If you wanna come don't have to wait
If you wanna come don't hesitate
Let me get to taste your honey child

Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate

Wave a flag or sing a song
When you come along let's celebrate
Climb aboard the fun mobile
There's plenty of room on the tailgate
There's plenty of room on the tailgate
Let me get to taste your honey child

Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate

Look for honey round the world
Find it in some special girl
Maybe one maybe eight
Makes no odds let's celebrate
Take some time and run around
Love the world or run it down
Trouble is it's getting late
Come with me let's celebrate

Let me get to taste your honey child
Let me get to taste your honey child
Let me get to taste your honey child
