Act of love is a luxury
The suit he wears belongs to me
The road is long, seven thousand miles
Soldier talk and uniform

We can live, I can live
Celebrate, celebrate
We can live, I can live
Celebrate, celebrate

She rag doll, keeps him warm
This negative shows no form
He salutes the crowd, go west, young man
Run, run, run, the hollow man

We can live, I can live
Celebrate, celebrate
We can live, I can live
Celebrate, celebrate

To a distant land, sand and sand
Touch to touch, a marble man
The house is glass, furniture's chrome
Soldier talk and uniform

We can live, I can live
Celebrate, celebrate
We can live, I can live
Celebrate, celebrate
