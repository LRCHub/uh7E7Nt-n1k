I can never say good-bye
Any special way
Everything i left behind
Will keep on callin'
Can't take an' understand
This masquerade
Look back look back
Who's to blame
For puttin' out fire

Like a moviestar
I would dream so far
An' you

You celebrate your life
An' with a one-way-ticket
You fly up to the sky
An' earth below is blue
You celebrate your time
But here i go
Don't celebrate my life

I can't try to hold it down
When you make your day
Everytime you cross the line
I'm way behind you
No need to to say our fate
Is just the same
I put myself in your place
There wasn't desire

Like a moviestar
I would dream so far
An' you

You celebrate your life
An' with a one-way-ticket
You fly up to the sky
An' earth below is blue
You celebrate your time
But here i go
Don't celebrate my life

And maybe it's you,
You celebrate your life,
And with a one-way-ticket you fly up to the sky,
And earth below is blue, you celebrate your time,
But here I go

Nanananana,
But I can try to understand it,
Nanananana,
I have just one life, I celebrate it,
Nanananana,
But I can try to understand it,
Nanananana,
I have just one life, I celebrate it,
Nanananana,
But I can try to understand it
Nanananana,
I have just one life, I celebrate it...
